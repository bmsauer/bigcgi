<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>Below is a list of proposed features, in no particular order of priority.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Chaining</dt>
  <dd>This allows apps to specify other apps to run automatically upon completion or error of an application</dd>
  <dt>Fast-CGIish Integration</dt>
  <dd>This would allow for long-standing processes to serve fast CGI requests. Should significantly improve performance, if needed</dd>
  <dt>Versioning</dt>
  <dd>This feature creates built in versioning of apps.  Basically, the applications would be stored in the database to allow fast rollback and the ability to run multiple versions of the same application.</dd>
  <dt><span style="color:green">API Control</span></dt>
  <dd>This enables developers to add, remove, update, and query applications via a RESTful API.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Green text denotes what is currently in progress.  What matters to you?  If you would like to see one of these, or any other, features implemented, drop me a line at bigcgi.app (_at_) gmail.com.</p>
