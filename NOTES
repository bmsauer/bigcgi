To make package of custom apache24: build port, then run "make package".  Package tar will be in
./work/pkg

Things to look into: fcgiwrap / fcgi over stdin/out instead of sockets

DEVLOG: 

-- 9-28-2017 --
Today I spent multiple hours working on a strange bug.  I was getting 403 Forbidden responses
from bigCGI.  This was only affecting the development vagrant box; production was unaffected.
I spent hours looking at the file permissions, rebuilding the apache package, playing with different
Vagrant boxes, disabling suExec, disabling userdir, reconfiguring both to no avail.  I compared config
on production and in the dev environment and almost everything was the same.  I spent a lot of time
looking into why the suexec log didn't exist, hence the recompiling of the package with different
options.

The problem turned out to be a difference in home directory links.  In production, /home is a link to
/usr/home, on this vagrant box, it was not.  UserDir was configured to go to /usr/home/*/public_html,
which, if the /home directory is a link to that location, works fine.  Otherwise, it is trying to serve
CGI from a directory it doesn't have permission to, aka 403.

It should be noted that this was not an issue before, as I had to change my Vagrant box from
10.3-STABLE to 10.3-RELEASE due to a recent update that broke the build.  **LESSONS LEARNED** -
FreeBSD continues to bite me, due to their crappy support for containerization/virtualization outside
of their jails.  Props to me for sticking with it, even though I knew it would boil down to something
ridiculous.  Dev logs are cathartic.

Today I pushed a commit to production that eliminates the Apache server for running CGI programs.  This
is a really big step, and I'm very proud of it.  When I set out to do logging for apps, I struggled for
a long time with Apache trying to get user/app specific logging.  I felt like I tried everything to
no avail; I floundered for a long time.  In the end I did the "unthinkable"; got rid of Apache and replaced
it with a custom CGI server implemented in Python.  I want to make note of this day because I took a
seemingly unsurmountable problem and solved it by completely abandoning what I thought was set in stone.
It gives me confidence that I can solve any problem thrown my way so long as I keep a creative open mind.
